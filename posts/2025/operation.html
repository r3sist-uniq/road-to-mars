<title>operating manual(s) for those in need</title>

<p>good morning. i want to talk to you, the real you. not that ego centre. i hope you're listening.</p>

<p>"There's a moment when a person starts fearing the shoddy, half-lived life of indulged anxiety more than the cold millstone of courage, and something instantly changes in them. They become spiritually taller and three times as attractive"</p>

<p>first of all - smile. smile right now. all hail metta!</p>

<p>today will go very fast and quickly, nothing will change in your life. only many many many mornings like this combined will make dents.</p>

<p>there is no one coming for rescue. mars or death. "close your heart to it"</p>

<p>nothing matters, it's just what you create or learn these days, and immerse yourself in. everything else is just forgotten.</p>

<p>but imagine you are on a long long long long vacation, studying society - understanding the world.</p>

<p>(before all this a note: please write down if you feel you're in some kind of hell - be aware, you wouldn't know most of the time).</p>

<p>you'll be thinking about things like bluemars or playing things like clair today or reading things like durant. wow. be grateful you are getting to do it.</p>

<p>get cheered - you are trying to understand industrial bases of earth these days.</p>

<p>you are starting life from scratch again (thought everyday is a new day) - no need to be boxxed in with ideas or people. be free, world is your oyster, if you get my intuition. like literally! travelling the world and sitting in libraries baby. have new friends, new people, new life, new work everything. no baggages.</p>

<p>again, you are JUST starting your life. JUST STARTING. things will take time. be patient please.</p>

<p>there is nothing to be scared of, there is nothing to be afraid of. GO DO THAT THING YOU WANT TO DO. there is nothing to be scared of, you're so scared in life. leave all the chains, all the shackles - you got a civilization to understand.</p>

<p>so be present. no tension at all. patient persistence and seriousness with eating mangoes and having laughs.</p>

<p>remember: the days will be hard brother. your issues aren't going anywhere - push through! sit and push through! fate of the universe depends on it.</p>

<p>i've already disowned the last couple years. strip away all the baggages. today is a new day. everyday is a new day. LIVE - you're ALIVE. I AM ALIVE.</p>

<p>to be honest, nothing really matters in the end you know. it's just what you create or do these days. like learning wild whistle hehe - everything else is just forgotten. so you can actually take comfort in that.</p>

<p>don't take yourself too seriously. you are one of billions right now here on this planet. you'll be fine. you are amongst the 100 billion (or more) that came here on this planet - give me a break. chill out, don't take your so seriously.</p>

<p>whatever you are doing today - think you want results or whatever you want to happen in 1 year. simple.</p>

<p>today is not a fight. don't fight the day. the world is your oyster.</p>

<p>you don't have to reach anywhere today, there is nowhere to go. be still, be present, be patient, be kind.</p>

<p>but you'll still restless like you always are. i will advise you to stick to this paper.</p>

<p>don't forgetâ€¦ you are just starting life. you literally are. it'll take time, it'll take years - for whatever you want to happen. just be present that you're here at this day at this moment in history and slowly build upto things.</p>

<p>nothing will happen this year. substance will take time - but do it with patience + seriousness. don't be boring - but things are going to take time. imagine you're starting to draw today - it's going to take time. imagine you're just starting to read the classics or history today - because equivalent of those things are what's going to happen.</p>

<p>think in terms of years. the taleb-joey life. you're building memories of your life which you'll remember forever. remember - you really are very young.</p>

<p>i'd love for you to slowly become so much radiant and personally agentic (yes that kind). but with patience (days are short) - slowly build upto so many things. and you're starting so that's great.</p>

<p>life is going on - it's so exciting, why pressure, why any tension. there is an entire planet to explore and to be that provocateur.</p>

<p>you'll literally starting to understand things, life and yourself.</p>

<p>be uncompromising, and don't be fake. strip away all those unneccessary implicit gaps in life. keep none of them. do justice to yourself. BE FREE.</p>

<p>these days, you're directly addressing the crisis/bluemars questions for the first time - it may take a while - don't worry. it really may take years. the work probably is very very difficult.</p>

<p>maybe good ideas will come to you today, maybe they won't. just build upto them and give them the space they need to come into existence.</p>

<p>it's just you. it's just me. in this big world doing things, thinking whatever and however under a rock - your own carmack peace. life is the carmack peace.</p>

<p>take the burden off your chest - DONT DO ANYTHING YOU DONT WANT TO - because you won't be able to do it - you'll go in a hell again. is there anything like this which you feel? sometimes these things are important - can't always escape - you can do everything, just dont take pressure.</p>

<p>no obligations, entire elden ring - 99.9% of humanity (probably) won't care/know what I do. you will sit in your little corner and just do things. it really is what it is.</p>

<p>a case can be made that you were born at a very good time. not too early that you can't even live properly but early enough that society is very recent, and things are still in their infancy. it's actually very exciting to think about you know?</p>

<p>imagine sitting above the blackhole drinking orange juice with your brother.</p>

<p>imagine you are a child. with the same aweness towards the world, curiosity and childlike wonder. be the child please. you still are a child.</p>

<p>but also remember that some feelings are good (content matters, not the source). it may be hard to understand but some rage, some frustration, somethings are good.</p>

<p>chill out! you are in deep existential crisis, and thinking about things like speedrunning the freaking planet, you are not going to get any answers today. you won't solve everything in a single day.</p>

<p>also, there is no school tomorrow. there is no school anymore, forever. don't look at the clocks and be scared. you have a distorted and corrupted perception of time, and life because of that. don't fear. try to unlearn all that.</p>

<p>there is no reason to be scared or fear.</p>

<p>but also, the day is long, vast and exciting. time doesn't exist. unlearn and change your relationship with time which you had to conjure up.</p>

<p>you cannot stop time. you don't have to, at all.</p>

<p>imagine the days as a single continuum of still life, working on single things at a time.</p>

<p>also tell me, are you perpetually waiting for something to happen? are you? that your days are sub optimal thinking - yes the perfect ones are just around that corner. TODAY is it. it really is.</p>

<p>the wait won't stop, everyone just keep waiting for something to happen.</p>

<p>and most of all - forget about the week, and what day today is. nothing will change from "monday". that's thinking is the result of a decade of school. forget about it. TODAY is it.</p>

<p>stop waiting for something to happen. break out of that cycle, it's been years.</p>

<p>be still! this is just one more day among the thousands you are going to live (hopefully) - day XX out of the thousands and thousands more to come. there is no ladder, just a flat playground - you being at this moment in history.</p>

<p>and most importantly which you have to understand right now i think, be free, please.</p>

<p>whatever you do today - do not go with the assumption that you need something to come out of it - maybe it will happen, maybe it won't. do not take that unnecessary pressure. just do what you do.</p>

<p>if you feel being pressured, restless because of being stuck somewhere - calm down. nothing will happen like that. it's not objective! why do you want things to happen fast, happen today?</p>

<p>thousands and thousands of days! this day will be a blip in time. just do what you do, be present and don't get restless because of that problem.</p>

<p>imagine the vast lands of panzerstorm and red dead - life is big, slow, much better elden. be patient, be happy, be crazy - do whatever you want - no one cares.</p>

<p>you'll be doing something when you're 22, 25, 29, 34, 38, 42, 49, 59.. and so on. life is big.</p>

<p>life is a playground, a large flat playground. live - think and be crazy - because why not? but don't be boring. most of life and people are very boring.</p>

<p>you are sharing this world with 8 billion other humans, under the shadow of a 100 billion more. let that sink in. imagine you as a 20 year old at this moment in history, today.</p>

<p>i know you probably feel a little boxxed in and frustrated wherever you are right now, you want to see life - see other amazing humans, be close to reality, some frontier, just live amazing - but you'll have to slowly build upto it. be patient, be grateful, think and work towards bringing that into existence. unstuck out of this moment in history.</p>

<p>so sorry, life is going to stay existentially boring for a few years i guess. assume it's going to take you a few more years to find what you really have to do.</p>

<p>and you are going to die soon- but it's fine, people die all the time. what if you die today? and you won't ever read this again?</p>

<p>remember, you are mortal.</p>

<p>you are living in a boring dystopia, stuck at this moment in time and you don't know what to do. so try to figure that out (hopefully by speedrunning), trying to make sense of the world by being close to reality and thus being a little prolific (shippable intermediaries are popper friendly required).</p>

<p>if you want to speedrun earth (or similar) - it will take years. and years are made up of these days. be patient, and maybe have a little sense of urgency regarding these small days. do not take pressure.</p>

<p>the purpose of life is probably to solve the knowledge problem, see the world and create.</p>

<p>you want godlike agency? you will have to build upto it. and it'll take time. it's almost as if you are stuck and you have to unstuck out of this moment in history.</p>

<p>it requires knowledge, wealth, and stature. you cannot force it in existence yet, you can only do what you can.</p>

<p>and forget about time (don't look at the clock) and forget about dates - you shouldn't even know them, why should you?</p>

<p>if you don't have a problem loaded in your working memory today, the day will go to "waste", so make peace with it and try loading one.</p>

<p>loading problems is very hard (just like learning) so your brain will find all kinds of way to slack. But today:</p>

<p>you can have a good routine today: meditate and exercise. decide on a problem, and load it in your working memory. work on that problem for the next 3 days. just do 1 thing at a time for now (if you get exhausted maybe do something else).</p>

<p>Even 5-6 hours of good work will compound to wonders. But to be at peace today, internalize that you're going to be working / thinking about that problem until you sleep. time doesn't exist - you have the entire day.</p>

<p>calm down and be in the space. imagine you are working on this problems for the next indefinite days. you have so many days. no pressure, time doesn't exist. just be still.</p>

<p>imagine you're doing one long stretch with breaks in between. think in terms of days.</p>

<p>bodily sensations find escape to the shortest path to minimizing compute cycles and uncertainty. DO HARD THINGS AND NON-DEFAULT ACTIONS. if you're doing hard things - it's probably ok. BE careful in doing things like making lists - they are always easier on heart. i SHOULD you really be doing it? productivity certainties are very real.</p>

<p>Sometimes if you really feel the need to work on something (or not) - notice it, understand it and maybe listen to it. contents of knowledge matter, not the sources. so give space for magic to exist.</p>

<p>just do 1 big deep work sitting today- even if you have to eat glass.</p>

<p>lists don't work and because time doesn't exist - spend time loading problems one at a time - and give yourself a few days of space to really work on it.</p>

<p>fundamentally: start thinking in terms of 3-4 days and around areas of problems. load things and work calmly. days move very very fast - nothing really happens if you aren't already doing something.</p>

<p>be in the magic space, be present and chill. DO NOT put bad information in your brain just to pass time. if you're working on something - do not eat. be completely still. like you know how to be.</p>
