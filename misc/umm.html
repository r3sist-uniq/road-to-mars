    <p><b>Contrary to popular belief, the world isn't incomprehensible.</b></p>
  <p>This life you live is very new. You aren't supposed to be living it, because in most periods of Homo Sapien history, you wouldn't have. Not even remotely close. And many still aren't.</p>
  <p>It's <i>only</i> been 200 years, so why don't you have <a href="https://amanmatreja.com/posts/2024/fair.html">a sense of urgency?</a></p>
  <p>And, do you know how the world works? Most people say it's too <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/is-technology-making-the-world-indecipherable">complex</a> to understand, that no one is "driving the wheel". But most people are dumb. </p>
  <p>Do you believe in <a href="https://perell.com/essay/peter-thiel/">human agency</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity">right</a> kind of optimism?</p>
  <p>The idea of our lab is simple. To understand autarkies, while delivering <a href="https://blog.comma.ai/the-unconjoined-triangle-of-success/">shippable intermediaries</a>.</p> 
  <p>We are building a tech tree of our industrial civilization. A material <i>and</i> a social tech tree. A map.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Why map? Because we are in the business of understanding the planet and not writing fiction, or coming up with yet <i>another</i> "theory" of history. Your map either works or it doesn't. It either represents reality and help people navigate it, or it doesn't.</p>
  <p>In a few years, bluemarslab will give way to <a href="bluemarsfund.com">bluemarsfund</a> and <a href="bluemarsindustries.com">bluemarsindustries</a>.</p>
 <p>The myth of romanticism is indeed a myth. And a terrible one at that. Can you tell us? Where we are and how did get here? How to industrialize the planet (and properly this time)? And most of all:</p>
 <p>How to prevent apocalypse? And. How to get back to the future?</p> 
  <p>We are modern-day mapmakers, we are your guild navigators.</p>
